 Overview
ClipMod is a Windows Forms clipboard enhancement tool built with C#. It includes features like clipboard history, global hotkey activation, emoji and GIF integration, and startup customization. You're using Guna UI2 controls for a modern interface.

 Features & Functionality

Tracks text and images copied to clipboard.

Maintains a history list of text (in lstText) and images (in flowImages).

Clicking a text or image re-copies it to clipboard with a confirmation message.

 Global Hotkey
Registers a hotkey (default: F5) to bring the app to the foreground.

Can be changed via btnHotkeySettings.

Hotkey registration uses RegisterHotKey and WndProc to intercept it globally.

Emojis are loaded from the GitHub Gemoji JSON file.

Displayed in webViewEmojis using dynamically generated HTML.

Clicking on an emoji copies it to the clipboard.

Supports search filtering via txtSearch.
